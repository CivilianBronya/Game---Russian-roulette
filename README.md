# Game---Russian-roulette
Inspired by the game 《Buckshot Roulette》, I restored the game in my own way using Python and added a two player mode
The overall code construction consists of four parts, most of which contain pygame and pymsgbox
At present, the Buckshot Roulette.py has undergone a brief test and cannot run properly under Buckshot Roulette.exe
Further modifications will be made and the interface will be beautified to make gameplay more comfortable
